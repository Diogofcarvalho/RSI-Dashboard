## Data Description

This project uses multiple datasets to characterize rental stress across Lisbon’s parishes. The data combines socioeconomic, housing, rental market, tourism, and spatial indicators, allowing the construction of a multidimensional Rental Stress Index (RSI).

The analysis is performed at the **parish level** (*freguesia*), which is the main territorial unit used throughout the project.

### 1. `DadosINE.xlsx`

This file contains socioeconomic and housing indicators from **INE – Instituto Nacional de Estatística**, mainly based on the 2021 Census.

The dataset includes variables such as:

- Total classic dwellings used for rental purposes;
- Fixed-term rental contracts;
- Open-ended rental contracts;
- Total classic dwellings;
- Unemployed population;
- Total population;
- Population under 15 years old;
- Working-age population;
- Population aged 65 and over;
- Education level indicators;
- Civil status variables.

These variables are used to describe the demographic and socioeconomic structure of each parish and to support the construction of indicators related to housing vulnerability and rental market stability.

The workbook also includes additional sheets with:

- Annual indicators by parish;
- Parish identifiers;
- Monthly rental price data;
- Airbnb-related data.

### 2. `Mediana_arrendamento.xlsx`

This file contains monthly rental price data by parish.

The main variables are:

- `Freguesia` – parish name;
- `ID` – parish code;
- `Mês` – month of observation;
- `Preço m2` – rental price per square meter.

This dataset is used to analyze the evolution of rental prices over time and to calculate rental market pressure indicators. The rental price per square meter is one of the key variables used to identify areas where housing costs are higher.

### 3. `RSI_por_Freguesia.xlsx`

This file contains the final **Rental Stress Index** values by parish.

The main variables are:

- `Freguesias` – parish name;
- `RSI` – Rental Stress Index score.

The RSI score ranges from **0 to 100**, where higher values indicate higher levels of rental stress. This file represents the final output of the index construction process and is used in the Power BI dashboard to visualize spatial patterns of rental pressure across Lisbon.

### 4. `Dados_SIG.xls`

This file contains spatial and geographic data used to support the territorial analysis of Lisbon’s parishes.

The SIG data is used to integrate the analytical indicators with geographic information, enabling spatial visualization and mapping in the dashboard. These data support the creation of choropleth maps and territorial comparisons between parishes.
